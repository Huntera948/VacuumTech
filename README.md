### Alex's README file

---
*A.  Create your subgroup and project by logging into GitLab using the web link provided and using the 
“GitLab How-To” web link, and do the following:*

*•   Clone the project to the IDE.*

*•   Commit with a message and push when you complete each of the tasks listed below (e.g., parts C to J).*

*Note: You may commit and push whenever you want to back up your changes, even if a task is not complete.*

*•   Submit a copy of the Git repository URL and a copy of the repository branch history retrieved from your 
repository, which must include the commit messages and dates.*

*Note: Wait until you have completed all the following prompts before you create your copy of the 
repository branch history.*

---

*B. Create a README file that includes notes describing where in the code to find the changes you made for 
each of parts C to J. Each note should include the prompt, file name, line number, and change.*

    For this step, I renamed the old README.md file to "oldREADME.md". I have named this file "README.md".

---
*C.  Customize the HTML user interface for your customer’s application. The user interface should 
include the shop name, the product names, and the names of the parts.*

*Note: Do not remove any elements that were included in the screen. You may add any additional elements you would like or 
any images, colors, and styles, although it is not required.*

*D.  Add an “About” page to the application to describe your chosen customer’s company to web viewers and include navigation
